# Tracking other phones 

## Introduction 

It is possible to also use FIND3 to setup a system that can do *passive scanning*. In *passive scanning*, you setup multiple computers which capture probe requests from phones and use those to classify their location.

A typical passive scanning system uses a network of Raspberry Pis which sniff the WiFi probe requests from WiFi-enabled devices and sends these parcels to a central server which compiles and forwards the fingerprint to the FIND server which then uses machine learning to classify the location based on the unique WiFi fingerprints.

This system does not require being logged into a particular WiFi - it will track any phone/device with WiFi enabled! (Caveat: for iOS devices it will only track if Wi-Fi is associated with a network - any network, though - because of MAC spoofing it uses for security). This system also does not require installing any apps on a phone. Tracking occurs anytime a WiFi chip makes a probe request (which is every minute or so). For this to work, it requires a one-time setup to populate the system with known fingerprints of known locations before it can pinpoint locations (see #3 below).

Note: It may be illegal to monitor networks for MAC addresses, especially on networks that you do not own. Please check your country's laws (for [US Section 18 U.S. Code ยง 2511](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511)) - [discussion](https://github.com/schollz/howmanypeoplearearound/issues/4).

## Prerequisites

You will need a Raspberry Pi. Ones with built-in Wifi work best:

- [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071L2ZQZX/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=scholl-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B071L2ZQZX&linkId=ab2f9d564a4f517c5b004a760d0d6e29)

Namely you want to find a USB adapter with one of the following chipsets: Atheros AR9271, Ralink RT3070, Ralink RT3572, or Ralink RT5572.

## Setup a scanner computer

For each scanner computer you will need to use the scanning software. Follow the instructions in the [Tracking your computer](/doc/tracking_your_computer.md) document to install the FIND3 command-line scanner.

As before, determine your **family name** (here `zack-family`), your **device name** (here `zack-device1`) and your WiFi interface (here `wlan0`). Make sure that the WiFi interface that you specify supports promiscuous mode.

## Start scanning passively

To start passively scanning, just do

```
$ find3-cli-scanner -i wlan0 -device zacks-device -family test-family \
    -server https://cloud.internalpositioning.com \
    -scantime 10 -forever -passive
```

This command-line flag `-passive` tells the scanner to capture the packets with `tshark`. This command will start a scanner that submits to the main server (**https://cloud.internalpositioning.com**). If you set the `-forever` flag it will also continue running forever.

In this command  the WiFi chip set/unset the promiscuous mode after every scan so that it can connect to the internet to upload the packets. This process takes about 10 seconds, so it is useful to set it permanently if you don't need to connect to the internet with the scanning interface (i.e. you have two WiFi interfaces).

If you have two WiFi interfaces, you can set one to be promiscuous permanently.

```
$ find3-cli-scanner -i wlan0 -set-promiscuous
```

Then, add the `-no-modify` flag to tell the tool not to alter the promsicuousness of the interface.

```
$ find3-cli-scanner -i wlan0 -device zacks-device -family test-family \
    -server https://cloud.internalpositioning.com \
    -scantime 10 -forever -passive -no-modify
```
