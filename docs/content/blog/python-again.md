Python has come back to FIND. Previous FIND contributor, <a href="https://github.com/schollz/find/commits?author=kootenpv">kootenpv</a> did a great job making a cool new Python package for doing indoor positioning: <a href="https://github.com/kootenpv/whereami">whereami</a>.
        

The package looks really cool, and I think I will try implementing random forests as well.
